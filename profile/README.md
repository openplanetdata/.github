## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Open Planet Data is an open initiative dedicated to making open data related to our beautiful planet earth more accessible and efficient to use.

Our first project offers daily snapshots of OpenStreetMap in PBF and GOL formats, proudly hosted on Cloudflare R2, a powerful storage service optimized for fast, scalable access to large datasets.
